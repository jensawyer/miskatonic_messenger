# 🏫 The Miskatonic Messenger

A React + Vite conduit for consulting the **Eldritch Oracle** — a whispering interface wrought in Strict TypeScript, woven 
with TailwindCSS, and bound by the iron chains of pinned dependencies.

## 🔮 Prerequisites
Before invoking the Messenger, be certain:
- You have successfully completed the [Eldritch Oracle setup](https://github.com/jensawyer/eldritch-oracle) and the agent is currently running.
- You possess Node.js 18.18+ (the LTS path is less perilous).
- You wield npm 9+.
- Most importantly: you hold **no fear of the madness** which may seep through the interface.
